# browser-tab-right

A Chrome extension to automatically move the active browser tab to the far right of the tab bar.

The beauty of this is that if you have lots of browser tabs open then the ones you used most recently are towards the right and the further left you go the longer it is since you looked at that tab, so locating tabs (or knowing which ones you can close) becomes much easier.

## Installing this extension

1. `git clone` this repo in the usual way
